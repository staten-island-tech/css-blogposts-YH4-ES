        <p>Oh man, this one has been a LOOONG time coming. The idea itself came to me while I was using my standard Roman defecation pit, when suddenly, I thought of a invention that would change the world.<br> Boring talk aside, I just got it patented yesterday! Should come to stores at around 2065, which is a lot faster than past production times due to a certain new sponsor.<br>Some of you may be wondering what it does, but you'll need to wait for that, I'm hoping to keep it a secret till launch date.</p>

        <h2 class="distinguishable">AIR!</h2>
        <p>Quick storytime:<br>
        After beating up a local homeless man from after having a bit too many drinks (lol oops), I realized that maybe we needed a new form of consumption. So I decided, that I would create something unanimous, Air! (The name was a workshop).
        <br> "But hey!", you may be saying. "You didn't invent air!" "Nobody did!" But you see, that is squirrel thinking. At least try for buffalo. Not capybara though, last time they tried to steal the government. <br>After a few years of working with my boys at the lab for 16 hours a day (this was before the new labor laws), we managed to create a fully functioning time machine which we used to DNA modify Adam and Eve to have lungs. We then had a private conversation with the Christian, Jewish, and Muslims gods, Zeus, Odin, Ra, Buddha. We managed to settle on an agreement and got a prototype working in a few days.<br> After which we had to ask for a small favor from Hades and Anubis to bring back Adam and Eve because we forgot we gave them lungs and they need oxygen now (double lol). The thing became massive afterwards, complete success (partially from economically incentivizing Adam and Eve to give a good word to their descendants)
        <br><br>So now, for the real purpose of this post. The exact details of the deal we made with the deities are classified, but, we came up with a small but good idea. I don't exactly run a charity here, see. And neither do the gods. (I mean, come on, do you see their demands nowadays? A whole goat for a single little favor from Lucifer? Ridiculous.) So, as part of what we came up with, everyone from every religion is now taxed for each consumption of air. This includes you, Atheists. Turns out the universe follows Rick Riordan laws so we bargained with the concepts of physics. Don't worry, the payment isn't exactly now, it'll just be paid through afterlife! Whatever soul or decomposing corpse you have or other's memories of you will be taken to be sold for extroadinate profits. So, if you want to avoid paying, just don't die. Simple as that.

        <h2 class="distinguishable">New blog site!</h2>
        <p>Announcement: The patent I had for my last website which I used to post my inventions ran out, so I've been forced to make a new one. I would transfer them over using this new site's "reblog from other sites" function, but I lost the patent on that too. Maybe I should've lobbied harder after created the immortality pill. Extended patents for immortal beings would've been useful. Too bad that my lobbying patent ran out too.</p>
